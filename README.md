# 🔧 MyFUSE — A Simple Custom File System in Userspace (FUSE)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**MyFUSE** is a minimalist, in-memory file system implemented in C using the [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) framework. It serves as a didactic example of how fundamental file system mechanisms—such as file creation, reading, writing, and directory listing—can be realized entirely in user space.

This project is particularly well-suited for educational purposes and for those seeking to understand the internal architecture of file systems. It illustrates how FUSE enables user-level processes to emulate kernel-level file system behavior through a well-defined API, making it possible to prototype or experiment with custom file system logic without modifying kernel code.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Dynamic file and directory creation
- ✅ `getattr` for file metadata
- ✅ `readdir` for directory listing
- ✅ `open` to handle file access
- ✅ `read` to retrieve content from memory
- ✅ `write` to update content dynamically
- ✅ Fully in-memory data storage using C structures

## Install dependencies
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libfuse-dev build-essential

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S fuse2

## 🛠 Build & Run
# Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myfuse.git
cd myfuse
# Build the project:
./build.sh
# Create a mount point and run:
mkdir /tmp/myfs
./myfs /tmp/myfs
# Unmount:
fusermount -u /tmp/myfs

## Example Usage
cd /tmp/myfs

# List directory contents
ls
# Output: file.txt

# Read a file
cat file.txt
# Output: [initial contents or empty]

# Write to a file
echo "Hello from FUSE!" > file.txt

# Read it back
cat file.txt
# Output: Hello from FUSE!

# Create new files dynamically
touch test1.txt
echo "This is a new file." > test1.txt
cat test1.txt
